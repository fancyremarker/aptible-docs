Scaling an Aptible app is easy! Just visit the [Aptible Dashboard](https://dashboard.aptible.com), navigate to your app, and then you'll see a list of all services associated with your app. (These are the services configured in your app's Procfile.)

To scale any of these services, adjust the container slider, and click "Scale." We'll immediately scale your app to the new size you've selected. If you want to scale your app back down at a later point, you can use the same slider.
