Aptible currently offers two plans:

* Development: With a development plan, you can deploy apps and databases using Aptible's platform with no up-front costs, paying only for the resources you use. Development apps and databases run in a multi-tenant environment on shared hardware within the AWS cloud. Therefore, a development plan cannot be used to handle or store ePHI. It can, however, be a great way to prototype apps and learn how Aptible works.
* Production: With a production plan, you can host apps and databases that handle real ePHI. As a production customer, all your apps and databases are hosted on dedicated hardware, inside an isolated cloud provisioned for your resources alone. (To learn about how this works, see our [Technology page](https://www.aptible.com/technology/).)
