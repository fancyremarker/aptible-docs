Aptible apps follow the [Twelve-Factor App model](http://12factor.net/), and per that model, all sensitive variables are passed to the app via environment variables.

For more information on configuring ENV variables for your Aptible app, see ["How do I set environment variables for my app?"](/topics/cli/how-to-set-environment-variables).
